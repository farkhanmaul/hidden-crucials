# Information Diet Design

*[DUMMY CONTENT]* Just as physical nutrition requires intentional curation, information consumption needs systematic design.

## The Information Nutrition Framework

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. This framework categorizes information types:

### Information Macronutrients

| Nutrient Type | Purpose | Daily Allocation | Examples |
|---------------|---------|------------------|----------|
| **Protein** | Deep Learning | 60% | Books, research papers |
| **Carbs** | Current Awareness | 25% | News, industry updates |
| **Fats** | Recreation | 15% | Entertainment, leisure |

### Information Toxins

> [DUMMY QUOTE] "The same way junk food crowds out nutritious meals, junk information crowds out valuable knowledge." - Sample attribution

Common information toxins include:

1. **Outrage content** designed for engagement
2. **Pseudo-information** that feels informative but isn't
3. **Addiction-driven** recommendation algorithms

## Implementation Strategy

Use this keyboard shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> to quickly assess information value.

### Daily Information Audit

```yaml
# Sample information tracking template
daily_consumption:
  high_value: 3_hours
  maintenance: 1_hour  
  recreation: 30_minutes
```
